# Fitness Website - Homepage

## About This Project
A while back, **Programming Hero** gave me an assignment to design a simple yet stylish **Fitness Website Homepage**. The goal was to create a landing page that encourages people to get in shape and stay healthy. Fast forward to now, and here it isâ€”built with **HTML & CSS**, and fully responsive for mobile devices!

## Features
- Sleek and modern design

- Encouraging and engaging layout to promote fitness
- Well-structured code, making it easy to customize

## Technologies Used
